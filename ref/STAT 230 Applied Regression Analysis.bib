	abstract = {Multidisciplinary research recently has been investigating solutions to offer new experiences of music making to musically untrained users. Our approach proposes to distribute the process of music making between the user and an autonomous agent by encoding this collaboration in the emotional domain. In this framework, users communicate the emotions they wish to express to Robin, the autonomous agent, which interprets this information to generate music with matching affective flavor. Robin is taught a series of basic compositional rules of tonal music, which are used to create original compositions in Western classical-like music. Associations between alterations to musical factors and changes in the communicated emotions are operationalized on the basis of recent outcomes that have emerged from research in the field of psychology of music. At each new bar, a number of stochastic processes determine the values of seven musical factors, whose combinations best match the intended emotion. The ability of Robin to validly communicate emotions was tested in an experimental study (N = 33). Results indicated that listeners correctly identified the intended emotions. Robin was employed for the purposes of two interactive artworks, which are also discussed in the article, showing the potential of the algorithm to be employed in interactive installations.},

	abstract = {Music listening – a quintessential instance of cultural consumption – has been heavily subjected to the logics of platformisation. This should be read in the context of the wider process of “liquidisation” of consumption fostered by digital media (Bardhi and Eckhardt, 2016), which has inevitably involved music too. Beginning in the late 1990s with the diffusion of the internet, the popularisation of digital media radically overturned the music business as a whole. Before then, music consumption was mainly centred around the ownership of physical records – vinyl and, later, CDs. The invention and subsequent popularisation of the MPEG encoding format},

	abstract = {Previous literature has shown that music preferences (and thus preferred musical features) differ depending on the listening context and reasons for listening (RL). Yet, to our knowledge no research has investigated how features of music that people dance or move to relate to particular RL. Consequently, in two online surveys, participants (N = 173) were asked to name songs they move to (“dance music”). Additionally, participants (N = 105) from Survey 1 provided RL for their selected songs. To investigate relationships between the two, we first extracted audio features from dance music using the Spotify API and compared those features with a baseline dataset that is considered to represent music in general. Analyses revealed that, compared to the baseline, the dance music dataset had significantly higher levels of energy, danceability, valence, and loudness, and lower speechiness, instrumentalness and acousticness. Second, to identify potential subgroups of dance music, a cluster analysis was performed on its Spotify audio features. Results of this cluster analysis suggested five subgroups of dance music with varying combinations of Spotify audio features: “fast-lyrical”, “sad-instrumental”, “soft-acoustic”, “sad-energy”, and “happy-energy”. Third, a factor analysis revealed three main RL categories: “achieving self-awareness”, “regulation of arousal and mood”, and “expression of social relatedness”. Finally, we identified variations in people’s RL ratings for each subgroup of dance music. This suggests that certain characteristics of dance music are more suitable for listeners’ particular RL, which shape their music preferences. Importantly, the highest-rated RL items for dance music belonged to the “regulation of mood and arousal” category. This might be interpreted as the main function of dance music. We hope that future research will elaborate on connections between musical qualities of dance music and particular music listening functions.},

	abstract = {The music industry and personal music consumption have evolved dramatically with the advent of streaming plat-forms. In this evolving landscape, there is considerable interest in understanding what factors contribute to a song's popularity. Extrinsic (i.e. non-acoustic) features of a given song, such as the record label, and/or intrinsic (i.e. acoustic) features such as its energy may contribute to popularity on a given digital platform. In this work, we, for the first time, sought to systematically study how a song's Spotify acoustic descriptive features correlated with popularity metrics on various Internet platforms. Since each platform defines “popularity” according to platform-specific metrics, a large-scale correlation-based analysis was generated. The digital platforms considered in this article are Google Trends, WhoSampled, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and the Billboard Top-100. Platform-specific scrapers were created and all data was aggregated with the Spotify Echo Nest dataset of descriptive acoustic metrics. While the majority of correlations were unre-markable considering both Spearman and Pearson coefficients, a number of corroborating and contradictory findings resulted, with notable implications for acoustic features on various digital platforms. Notably, the YouTube view count was found to be positively correlated to the Spotify song popularity (p = 0.822), year (p = 0.600), and energy (p = 0.455) and moderately negatively correlated to accousticness (p = −0.542) and instrumentalness (p = −0.345). All reproducing code and aggregated data from this work are open-source for use by the broader research community.},

In this paper, we present an analysis of the music charts using many features that describe a song such as acousticness, danceability, etc., and present artist-specific suggestions that can help the artists know the genre of the songs that is most popular among the listeners and therefore, produce songs accordingly and hence help the artists gain popularity among the audience.},

	abstract = {Self-selected music is the best predictor of a successful outcome in music interventions, but the reasons behind this are unclear. One suggestion is that patients choose different types of music compared to experimenters. To explore this suggestion, the current study identified specific pieces of music that were used in previous studies for pain management using a scoping review, and analyzed each track in terms of the Spotify audio features of energy, danceability, instrumentalness, valence, and tempo. Music was categorized depending on whether it was chosen by the patient from an unlimited choice (PUC), a limited choice (LC), or chosen by the experimenter (EC), so that comparisons could be made between groups. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) identified that PUC music was significantly higher in energy and danceability, and lower in instrumentalness, compared to LC or EC music. A logit ordinal regression demonstrated that as people are given more freedom to choose music to reduce their pain, they increasingly choose music that is higher in energy and danceability, and more likely to contain lyrics. This study also demonstrates the impact of allowing patients to choose music from an unlimited range compared to choosing from a limited range of music.},
